## What is Vibedropper?

Vibedropper is a modern platform that combines **email marketing** and **drop commerce**. You can grow and manage your audience with lists and embeddable forms, send campaigns with a drag-and-drop editor, and run **list-gated drops** — time-limited offers that only subscribers with access can shop.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Organization** | Your brand or workspace. All lists, campaigns, drops, and customers are scoped to an org. |
| **List** | An email list. Subscribers belong to lists; lists can have tiers and power campaign audiences and drop access. |
| **Drop** | A time-limited, list-gated offer with a public storefront. Only subscribers who have access (via list or tier) can shop. |
| **Campaign** | An email campaign. Build with the drag-and-drop editor, choose audiences from lists or segments, then send or schedule. |
