## Overview

Vibedropper can send **outbound webhooks** when certain events occur (e.g. subscriber added, campaign sent, order created). You configure one or more webhook URLs per organization in **Settings** → **API**. Each delivery is signed so you can verify it came from Vibedropper.

## Webhook spec

The full webhook specification (events, payload shape, signature) is available at:

**GET** `/api/v1/webhooks/spec`

Use this in your app to see event types and payload structures.

## Signature verification

Every webhook request is signed with **HMAC-SHA256** using your webhook secret.

- **Header**: `X-Webhook-Signature`
- **Format**: `sha256=<hex>`
- **Computation**: `HMAC-SHA256(raw_request_body_utf8, webhook_secret)`

To verify:

1. Read the raw request body (UTF-8).
2. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(body, your_webhook_secret)`.
3. Encode the result as hex and compare with the value after `sha256=` in `X-Webhook-Signature` using a **constant-time** comparison to avoid timing attacks.

<Warning>
Do not trust the payload without verifying the signature. The secret is shown when you create or view the webhook in Settings → API.
</Warning>

## Event types (summary)

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `subscriber.added` | Subscriber was added to a list |
| `subscriber.removed` | Subscriber was removed or unsubscribed |
| `subscriber.bounced` | Subscriber marked as bounced (SES) |
| `subscriber.complained` | Subscriber complained (SES) |
| `campaign.sent` | Campaign was sent |
| `campaign.scheduled` | Campaign was scheduled |
| `order.created` | Order was created (drop store) |

Payload structure: top-level `event`, `timestamp`, and `data` (event-specific). Exact fields are in the webhook spec.

## Configuring webhooks

1. Go to **Settings** → **API** (or **Webhooks**).
2. Add a webhook URL and (if applicable) select events.
3. Save. Store the webhook secret securely; use it only for signature verification.

The app will POST to your URL when events occur. Respond with `2xx` quickly; the app may retry on failure according to its retry policy.
