---

## Overview

The **Public API (v1)** lets you integrate with Vibedropper using an **API key**. You can manage lists, subscribers, customers, and campaigns programmatically. The API is REST-style and returns JSON.

## Base URL

Use your app origin as the base URL. For example:

- **Production**: `https://app.vibedropper.com`
- **Local**: `http://localhost:3000`

All v1 endpoints are under the `/api/v1` path.

## OpenAPI spec

The full OpenAPI 3.0 spec is available at:

**GET** `/api/v1/openapi`

Use this URL in Swagger UI, Postman, or any OpenAPI client to explore endpoints, request/response schemas, and error formats.

## Authentication

All v1 endpoints require an **API key** scoped to an organization. Create keys in the dashboard under **Organization Settings** → **API**.

Send the key in one of these ways:

- **Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>`
- **Header**: `X-API-Key: <your_api_key>`

Invalid or missing keys return `401` with a JSON error. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

## Endpoints (summary)
