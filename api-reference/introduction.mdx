<Info>
This section is for **developers and integrators** who want to connect their own apps or scripts to Vibedropper. If you’re only using the dashboard, see the [Guides](/).
</Info>

## Overview

The **Vibedropper Public API (v1)** lets you integrate with Vibedropper using an **API key**. Manage lists, subscribers, customers, and campaigns programmatically. The API is REST-style and returns JSON.

## Base URL

All API requests use this base URL:

**`https://vibedropper.com/api/v1`**

Example: to list lists, request **GET** `https://vibedropper.com/api/v1/lists` with your API key in the headers.

## OpenAPI spec

The full OpenAPI 3.0 spec is available at:

**[https://vibedropper.com/api/v1/openapi](https://vibedropper.com/api/v1/openapi)**

Use this URL in Swagger UI, Postman, Insomnia, or any OpenAPI client to explore endpoints, request/response schemas, and error formats. The spec defines the **VibeDropper API** (lists, subscribers, customers, campaigns) and uses Bearer API key authentication.

## Authentication

All endpoints require an **API key** from **Settings → API** in your Vibedropper dashboard at [vibedroppers.com](https://vibedroppers.com). Send it in every request as:

- **Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>`, or  
- **Header**: `X-API-Key: <your_api_key>`

Missing or invalid keys return `401` with a JSON error. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

## Endpoints (summary)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/lists` | List lists (paginated) |
| GET | `/lists/{listId}` | Get a list |
| GET | `/lists/{listId}/subscribers` | List subscribers |
| POST | `/lists/{listId}/subscribers` | Add subscriber |
| DELETE | `/lists/{listId}/subscribers/{subscriberId}` | Remove subscriber |
| GET | `/customers` | List customers |
| GET | `/customers/{customerId}` | Get customer |
| PATCH | `/customers/{customerId}` | Update customer |
| GET | `/campaigns` | List campaigns |

Full URL base: **`https://vibedropper.com/api/v1`**. Request/response shapes and error format are in the [OpenAPI spec](https://vibedropper.com/api/v1/openapi).

## Webhooks

Configure outbound webhooks in your dashboard under **Settings → API**. Events include subscriber added/removed, campaign sent, order created, and more. Webhook event types, payload format, and **X-Webhook-Signature** (HMAC-SHA256) verification are documented at **GET** [https://vibedropper.com/api/v1/webhooks/spec](https://vibedropper.com/api/v1/webhooks/spec). See [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) for a guide.
