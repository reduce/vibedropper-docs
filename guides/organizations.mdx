## What is an organization?

An **organization** is your brand or workspace in Vibedropper. All your lists, campaigns, drops, orders, and settings belong to one organization. You can be in more than one organization and switch between them from the header.

Each organization has a **slug**—a short name used in URLs (e.g. `my-brand`). You choose it when you create the organization.

## Creating your first organization

When you sign up and don’t have an organization yet, you’re guided to create one:

1. Enter your **organization name** and **slug**.
2. Optionally set **brand colors** and upload a **logo**.
3. Click **Create**.

You’re then taken to that organization’s Dashboard.

## Switching organizations

Use the organization switcher in the header to change which organization you’re working in. Each organization has its own Dashboard, Subscribers, Campaigns, Forms, Drops, Orders, and Settings.

## Onboarding

After you create an organization, you may see onboarding steps or a checklist. Use them to create your first list, form, or drop. You can also skip and explore from the sidebar.

## Team and roles

From **Settings** → **Members** you can invite people to your organization. Roles control what they can do:

- **Admin** — Full access, including settings and team.
- **Member** — Can manage lists, campaigns, drops, and orders (depending on your setup).
- **Shop manager** — Can be limited to the Orders area for a specific region or pickup location.

Invited people receive an email with a link to join. When they accept, they’re added to the organization with the role you chose.
