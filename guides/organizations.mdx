## What is an organization?

An **organization** (org) is your workspace in Vibedropper. All lists, campaigns, drops, catalog, customers, and settings are scoped to an org. You can belong to multiple orgs and switch between them from the dashboard.

Each org has a unique **slug** used in URLs (e.g. `/org/my-brand`).

## Creating your first organization

After you sign up or log in, the app redirects you to **onboarding** if you have no organization yet.

1. Go to **Dashboard** (or `/dashboard`). You are redirected to `/onboarding` when you have no orgs.
2. Complete the onboarding wizard:
   - **Name** and **slug** for your organization
   - **Brand theme** (optional): primary, secondary, accent, background, and other colors
   - **Logo** (optional)
3. Click **Create** to create the org. You are then taken to the org dashboard.

<Note>
You can create more organizations later from the dashboard or profile. Each org has its own onboarding state and settings.
</Note>

## Organization dashboard

At `/org/[slug]` you get:

- **Overview** (stats, recent activity)
- **Navigation** to Lists, Campaigns, Forms, Drops, Catalog, Customers, Orders, Pages, Settings

Use the org switcher in the header to change organizations.

## Members and roles

- **Admin**: Full access; can manage settings, members, and invites.
- **Member**: Can manage lists, campaigns, drops, catalog, customers, and orders; access depends on your role configuration.

Invite members from **Settings** → **Team** (or equivalent). They receive an email with an invite link; accepting adds them to the org with the assigned role.

## Onboarding (org-level)

Some orgs show an **onboarding** checklist or flow at `/org/[slug]/onboarding`. Use it to complete setup (e.g. first list, first form, or first drop).
