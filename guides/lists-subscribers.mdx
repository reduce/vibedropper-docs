## Subscribers area

From the sidebar, open **Subscribers** to manage your audience. Here you’ll see your **lists**, **segments**, and **contacts**. You can switch between list view, segment view, and tag view using the tabs or sidebar.

## Lists

A **list** is a group of subscribers. You use lists to:

- Choose who receives **campaigns**.
- Control who can access a **drop** (by list or tier).

### Creating a list

1. In **Subscribers**, go to the lists section.
2. Click **Create list** (or **Add list**).
3. Enter a name and optional description, then save.

### List tiers

Lists can have **tiers** (e.g. free vs paid). You use tiers when building **segments** or when deciding who can access a drop. Create and edit tiers from the list’s detail or tiers page.

## Adding subscribers

You can add people to a list in several ways:

- **Import** — Upload a CSV from the list or subscribers view.
- **Add in bulk** — Add multiple emails (and optional fields) in the UI.
- **Forms** — Publish a signup form or share its link; new signups are added to the list you chose.

You can turn on **double opt-in** so new signups must confirm their email before they’re marked as subscribed.

## Subscriber status

Each subscriber has a status:

- **Subscribed** — Receives campaigns and can access list-gated drops (if allowed).
- **Unsubscribed** — Has opted out; they don’t receive emails.
- **Pending** — Waiting for double opt-in confirmation.
- **Bounced** — Address is no longer valid; we don’t send to them.

Unsubscribe links in your emails let people opt out with one click. Bounced and complained addresses are updated automatically so you don’t send to them again.

## Segments

**Segments** are dynamic groups based on rules (e.g. subscribed, on a certain list, in a tier, or custom fields). You can:

- **Evaluate** a segment to see who matches.
- **Preview the count** for campaign planning.
- Use segments as **campaign audiences**.

Create and edit segments from the Subscribers area (e.g. **Segments** in the sidebar or tabs).

## Tags and custom fields

If your organization uses **tags**, you can assign them to subscribers and filter or target by tag. **Custom fields** let you store extra information (e.g. phone, company) and use it in segments and personalization.

## Regions and pickup

If you use **regions** and **pickup locations**, you can collect them at signup and use them for fulfillment and reporting. Set up regions under **Settings** → **Regions**.
