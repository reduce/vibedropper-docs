## Lists

A **list** is an email list that holds your subscribers. You use lists to:

- Build campaign audiences
- Gate drop access (only certain lists or tiers can shop)
- Segment with **segments** (dynamic rules)

### Creating a list

1. Open **Lists** from the org sidebar.
2. Click **Create list** (or equivalent).
3. Enter a name and optional description. Save.

Lists can have **tiers** (e.g. free vs paid). Tiers are used for segmentation and for controlling who can access a drop.

### List tiers

- Create and edit tiers from the list detail page (`/org/[slug]/lists/[listId]/tiers`).
- Use tiers when building segments or when configuring drop access.

## Subscribers

Subscribers belong to lists and have a **status**:

- **Subscribed** — Receives campaigns and can access list-gated drops (if allowed).
- **Unsubscribed** — Opted out; no emails.
- **Pending** — Awaiting double opt-in confirmation.
- **Bounced** — Marked from SES bounce handling.

### Adding subscribers

- **Import**: Upload a CSV from the list or subscribers view.
- **Batch add**: Add multiple emails (and optional fields) via the UI.
- **Forms**: Publish an embeddable form or signup link; new signups are added to the chosen list (with optional double opt-in and region/pickup).

### Double opt-in

When enabled for a list or form, new signups receive a confirmation email. They become **subscribed** only after they click the confirmation link. Pending subscribers appear as **pending** until confirmed.

### Unsubscribe and bounces

- **Unsubscribe**: Emails include an unsubscribe link; one-click unsubscribe updates status and is tracked.
- **Bounces/complaints**: AWS SES can send events to a webhook; the app updates subscriber status (e.g. bounced) so you don’t send again.

## Segments

**Segments** are dynamic groups based on rules (e.g. “subscribed”, “on list X”, “in tier Y”, custom fields). You can:

- **Evaluate** a segment to see who matches.
- **Count** the segment for audience sizing.
- Use segments as **campaign audiences** or in reporting.

Create and edit segments under **Subscribers** (e.g. `/org/[slug]/segments`).

## Custom fields and region/pickup

- **Custom fields**: Define custom fields on lists or org; collect them on signup forms and use them in segments and personalization.
- **Region / pickup**: If you use regions and pickup locations, you can collect them at signup and use them for fulfillment and reporting.

## Subscriber views

- **By list**: Open a list and view its subscribers.
- **By segment**: Open a segment to see matching subscribers.
- **By tag**: View subscribers by tag (if your org uses tags).

From these views you can import, export, and (where supported) batch update status or fields.
