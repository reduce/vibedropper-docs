## What is a drop?

A **drop** is a time-limited offer that only certain subscribers can shop. You create a drop, add products from your **catalog**, and choose which lists or tiers have access. Those subscribers get a link; they enter their email, receive a sign-in link, and can shop on the drop’s **storefront**.

## Creating a drop

1. Open **Drops** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Create drop** (or **New drop**).
3. Set:
   - **Name** and URL slug
   - **Start and end date/time** (optional)
   - **Audience** — which lists or tiers can access the drop
   - **Store layout** — add sections (product grid, banner, text, countdown, etc.) in the drop editor

4. Add **products** from your catalog. Set quantity, variants, and pricing for the drop.
5. Save. You can **clone** an existing drop to copy its setup.

## Designing the drop store

In the drop editor you can add and arrange **blocks**, for example:

- Product grid, banner, heading, text, image
- Columns, cards, spacer, divider
- Countdown, button, video, FAQ, testimonial
- Stats, logo strip, pricing, feature list

Some accounts can use **AI** to suggest a layout. **Revisions** let you compare or restore earlier versions.

## Products (catalog)

Your **catalog** holds your products. From **Products** in the sidebar (admins only when drops are enabled), you can add products with:

- Title, description, and handle
- **Variants** (e.g. size, color)
- **Images**
- **Collections** to group products

When you build a drop, you add catalog products as drop items and set quantity and pricing for that drop.

## Sending the drop to your audience

From the drop page you can **Send** or **Notify** your audience—for example, email the list with the drop link. Subscribers use the link, enter their email, and get a sign-in link to the store.

The **store URL** looks like:  
`https://vibedropper.com/sites/your-org/drops/your-drop`  
(or your custom domain). Share this URL; only subscribers with access can complete the sign-in and shop.

## How customers get access

1. They visit the drop URL.
2. They enter their email. We check if that email has access (list/tier).
3. If yes — they get a sign-in link and can open the store, add to cart, and checkout.
4. If no — they see a message that they don’t have access, or can sign up for the list if you’ve set that up.

## Orders

Orders from the drop appear under **Orders** in the sidebar. You can list, filter, export, and mark orders ready. See [Orders & fulfillment](/guides/customers-orders).
