## What is a drop?

A **drop** is a time-limited, **list-gated** offer. You create a drop, attach products from your **catalog**, and choose which lists or tiers have access. Subscribers who have access receive a link (e.g. via email or “Send drop” from the dashboard); they enter their email, get a magic link, and can shop on the drop’s **public storefront**.

## Creating a drop

1. Open **Drops** from the org sidebar.
2. Click **Create drop** (or equivalent).
3. Set:
   - **Name** and slug/URL
   - **Start and end time** (optional)
   - **Audience**: which lists or tiers can access
   - **Store layout**: add blocks (product grid, banner, heading, text, CTA, countdown, etc.) in the drop editor

4. Add **items** from your catalog (products). Configure quantity, variants, and pricing as needed.
5. Save. You can **clone** an existing drop to reuse setup.

## Drop store editor

The drop has a **store editor** with blocks/sections, for example:

- Product grid, banner, heading, text, image
- Grid (columns), container (flex), cards, spacer, divider
- Countdown, CTA, video, FAQ, testimonial, badge, stats, logo cloud
- Pricing tiers, feature list, guarantee

You can use **AI generate** (when available) to draft the store layout. **Revisions** let you compare or restore previous layouts.

## Catalog

The **catalog** holds your products. Products can have:

- Title, description, handle/slug
- **Variants** (e.g. size, color)
- **Images**
- **Collections** for grouping

Create and edit products under **Catalog** (`/org/[slug]/catalog`). When building a drop, you add **catalog products** as drop items and set quantity and pricing for the drop.

## Sending a drop

- **Send drop**: From the drop detail page you can “Send” or “Notify” the audience (e.g. email to the list with the drop link). Subscribers use the link, enter email, and get a magic link to the store.
- **Public URL**: The storefront lives at `/sites/[orgSlug]/drops/[dropSlug]`. Share this URL; only subscribers with access can complete the magic-link flow and shop.

## Access flow (customer)

1. User visits the drop URL.
2. Enters email. App checks if that email has access (list/tier).
3. If yes: user receives a magic link and can open the store, add to cart, and checkout.
4. If no: user sees a message that they don’t have access or can sign up for the list (if you’ve configured that).

## Orders

Orders placed on a drop appear under **Orders** in the org. You can list, filter, export, and mark orders ready. See [Customers & orders](/guides/customers-orders).
