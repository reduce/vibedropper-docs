## What is a campaign?

A **campaign** is an email you send to an audience (one or more lists or segments). You design it with the **Topol.io** drag-and-drop editor, then send immediately or schedule for later.

## Creating a campaign

1. Open **Campaigns** from the org sidebar.
2. Click **Create campaign**.
3. Choose a template or start from scratch. You are taken to the campaign editor.

## Editor (Topol.io)

The campaign editor is powered by **Topol.io**. You can:

- Drag and drop blocks (text, images, buttons, columns, etc.)
- Use **merge tags** for personalization (e.g. `{{first_name}}`, `{{email}}`).
- Insert an **unsubscribe link** (required for compliance).
- Preview and send test emails.

<Tip>
You need a valid **Topol.io API key** in your environment (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TOPOL_API_KEY`) for the editor to load. Get it from [app.topol.io](https://app.topol.io) → **Settings** → **Plugin**.
</Tip>

## Choosing an audience

Before sending, you choose the **audience**:

- One or more **lists**, or
- One or more **segments**

The app calculates the audience size. Only **subscribed** subscribers (and segment rules) are included.

## Sending and scheduling

- **Send now**: Sends to the full audience immediately (or via queue if BullMQ is configured).
- **Schedule**: Set a date and time; the campaign is queued and sent at that time.

After sending, you can view **opens** and **clicks** (if tracking is enabled). A **webhook** can fire when a campaign is sent (see [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks)).

## Revisions and AI

- **Revisions**: The app can store revisions of the campaign design so you can compare or restore.
- **AI generate**: Some flows offer AI-generated content or subject lines; use them from the campaign or audience step when available.

## Duplicate and test

- **Duplicate**: Create a copy of an existing campaign to reuse design and audience.
- **Test email**: Send a test to your own email before sending to the full audience.
