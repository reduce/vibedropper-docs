## What is a campaign?

A **campaign** is an email you send to an audience (one or more lists or segments). You design it in the campaign editor, choose who receives it, then send immediately or schedule for later.

## Creating a campaign

1. Open **Campaigns** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Create campaign** (or **New campaign**).
3. Pick a template or start from a blank design. You’ll open the campaign editor.

## Designing your email

In the editor you can:

- **Drag and drop** blocks (text, images, buttons, columns, etc.).
- Use **personalization** (e.g. first name, email) so each recipient sees their own details.
- Add an **unsubscribe link** (required for compliance).
- **Preview** and send **test emails** to yourself before sending to everyone.

When you’re done designing, save your changes.

## Choosing your audience

Before sending, you choose who receives the campaign:

- One or more **lists**, or
- One or more **segments**

The app shows how many people will receive it. Only **subscribed** subscribers (and your segment rules) are included.

## Sending and scheduling

- **Send now** — Sends to the full audience right away.
- **Schedule** — Pick a date and time; the campaign is sent automatically at that time.

After sending, you can see **opens** and **clicks** in the campaign details. If you use webhooks, you can also get notified when a campaign is sent (see **Settings** → **API**).

## Revisions and duplicate

- **Revisions** — The app can save versions of your design so you can compare or restore an earlier version.
- **Duplicate** — Create a copy of an existing campaign to reuse the design and audience.
