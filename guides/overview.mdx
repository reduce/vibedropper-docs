## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Organization** | Your tenant. All data (lists, campaigns, drops, catalog, customers) is scoped to an org. Identified by `slug` in URLs (e.g. `/org/my-brand`). |
| **List** | Email list. Subscribers belong to lists; lists can have tiers and power campaign audiences and drop access. |
| **Drop** | Time-limited, list-gated offer. Has a public storefront; only subscribers with access (via list/tier) can shop. |
| **Campaign** | Email campaign. Drag-and-drop editor, templates, scheduling, tracking. Audiences from lists or segments. |

## Main features

### Email & lists

- **Lists**: Create, reorder, add tiers. Subscribers have status (subscribed, unsubscribed, pending, bounced). Custom fields, region/pickup at signup.
- **Segments**: Dynamic segments with rules; evaluate and count.
- **Forms**: Embeddable signup forms (HTML or direct link); optional region/pickup for list growth.
- **Subscribers**: Import/export, batch add, double opt-in confirm, one-click unsubscribe. SES webhook for bounces and complaints.
- **Campaigns**: Create, edit (Topol.io editor), render, send, test, duplicate. Revisions and AI generate. Audience from lists/segments; open/click tracking.

### Drops & store

- **Drops**: Create, edit (store editor with blocks/sections), clone. Items from catalog; audience by list/tier; send (notify list). Revisions and AI-generated store layout.
- **Catalog**: Products (variants, images, collections). Used by drop items.
- **Public store**: List-gated; email → magic link; cart, checkout, order confirmation.
- **Orders**: List, filter, export, mark ready; edit order (e.g. fulfillment). Regions and pickup locations.

### Customers & organization

- **Customers**: From store orders or manual add; linked to subscribers. Profile, activity, filter/bulk.
- **Regions & locations**: Geographic regions and pickup locations; taxes. Used for signup, checkout, and fulfillment.
- **Tiers**: List tiers (e.g. free vs paid); used for segments and drop access.
- **Org settings**: Branding, domains, API keys, webhooks. Members, roles, invites.

## Key flows

1. **List growth** — Form embed or direct link → subscribe (optional confirm) → subscriber on list; optional region/pickup.
2. **Drop access** — User visits drop URL → enters email → access verified against list/tier → magic link → can shop.
3. **Campaign** — Pick list/segment → build email → send or schedule → tracking (opens/clicks); webhook on send.
4. **Order** — Add to cart (drop store) → checkout (customer/address, region, payment) → order created → webhook; admin marks ready.
