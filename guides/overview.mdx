## What Vibedropper is for

Vibedropper combines **email** and **list-gated drops** so you can own your audience and run exclusive offers. You build lists, send campaigns, and create drops that only certain subscribers can shop.

## Main areas

| Area | What you do here |
|------|------------------|
| **Dashboard** | See a summary of your audience, recent campaigns and drops, and quick actions. |
| **Subscribers** | Manage lists, add or import subscribers, create segments, and view contacts. |
| **Campaigns** | Create emails, choose who receives them, and send or schedule. |
| **Forms** | Build signup forms and get embed code or a link to grow your lists. |
| **Drops** | Create list-gated drops, design the store, and share the link with your audience. |
| **Pages** | Create custom landing pages for your brand. |
| **Orders** | View orders from your drops, filter by location, mark ready, and export. |
| **Products** | Manage your product catalog (used when building drops). Admins only when drops are enabled. |
| **Settings** | Set organization name, brand, cart limits, email settings, team, regions, domains, and API. |

## How it fits together

1. **Lists** hold your subscribers. You can add people manually, import them, or collect signups with **forms**.
2. **Campaigns** go to one or more lists or segments. You design the email, pick the audience, then send or schedule.
3. **Drops** are time-limited stores. You choose which lists or tiers have access; those subscribers get a link and can shop. Orders show up under **Orders**.
4. **Settings** control how your brand looks, who’s on your team, where you deliver (regions), and how you send email.
