## Overview

Social connections in Vibedropper are powered by [Late.dev](https://getlate.dev) — a social media scheduling API that supports 13+ platforms. Each organization has one **Late Profile** that groups its connected social accounts. The profile is created when you connect your first account.

## Setup

1. Create an account at [getlate.dev](https://getlate.dev).
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys** → **Create API Key**.
3. Add the key to your environment:

```env
LATE_API_KEY=sk_...
```

4. Restart the app. The **Social** page in your org will use this key to list and connect accounts.

## Connecting accounts

1. Open **Settings** → **Social** (or **Social** from the org sidebar).
2. Click **Connect** for a platform (e.g. Twitter, Instagram).
3. You are redirected to Late’s OAuth flow for that platform. Authorize the app.
4. After redirect back, the account appears in the list. You can disconnect from the same page.

## What you can do

- **Connect** multiple platforms per org (within Late’s limits).
- **Disconnect** an account from the Social page.
- Use Late’s scheduling and posting features according to your Late plan; Vibedropper provides the connection UI and stores the org’s Late profile ID.

## API behavior

- **List accounts**: `GET /api/orgs/[slug]/social/accounts` — returns connected accounts for the org’s Late profile.
- **Connect**: `POST /api/orgs/[slug]/social/connect` with `{ platform: "twitter" }` (or other platform) — returns or redirects to Late’s OAuth URL.
- **Disconnect**: `DELETE /api/orgs/[slug]/social/accounts/[accountId]` — removes the account from the profile.

The app lazily creates a Late Profile for the org on first connect and stores the profile ID on the organization.
