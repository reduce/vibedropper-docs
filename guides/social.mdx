## Social connections

If your organization has **Social** enabled, you can connect your social accounts from **Settings**. Once connected, you can use the linked tools to schedule or publish posts to those channels.

## Connecting an account

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to the **Social** section (or the tab/section where social is shown).
3. Click **Connect** for the platform you want (e.g. Twitter, Instagram).
4. Complete the sign-in and permission steps in the window that opens.
5. When you’re sent back to Vibedropper, the account appears as connected.

## Disconnecting

From the same Social section, you can **Disconnect** an account. This removes the connection; you can connect again later if you want.

## What you can do

Connected accounts are available for posting and scheduling according to your plan. Use the Social area to manage which accounts are linked and to create or schedule content for those channels.
