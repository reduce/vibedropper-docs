## What are forms?

**Forms** are signup forms that add people to your lists. You can embed a form on your website or share a direct link. Forms can collect email and optional fields (e.g. name, region) and support double opt-in.

## Creating a form

1. Open **Forms** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Create form** (or **New form**).
3. Set:
   - **Title** and optional description
   - **List** (and optionally tier) to add subscribers to
   - **Fields** — email (required), plus any optional fields you want
   - **Double opt-in** — Turn on to send a confirmation email before they’re marked as subscribed
   - **Region / pickup** — If you use regions, you can collect them on the form

Save the form. You’ll get an **embed code** and a **direct link**.

## Embedding a form

Copy the **embed code** from the form’s share or embed section. Paste it into your website or landing page. When someone submits, they’re added to the list you chose.

## Sharing the link

You can also share the form’s **direct link**. Visitors open that page and sign up there. The link looks like:  
`https://vibedroppers.com/sites/your-org/forms/your-form`  
(or your custom domain if you’ve set one up).

## Submissions and status

View **submissions** from the form’s page. Each submission creates or updates a subscriber on the list. If you use **revisions**, you can preview or restore earlier versions of the form.
