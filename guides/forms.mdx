## What are forms?

**Forms** are embeddable signup forms that add subscribers to your lists. You can embed them on your site (HTML snippet) or share a direct link. Forms support optional double opt-in, custom fields, and region/pickup when configured.

## Creating a form

1. Open **Forms** from the org sidebar.
2. Click **Create form** (or equivalent).
3. Configure:
   - **Name** and optional description
   - **List** (and optionally tier) to add subscribers to
   - **Fields**: email (required), optional first name, last name, and custom fields
   - **Double opt-in**: Turn on to send a confirmation email before marking as subscribed
   - **Region / pickup**: If your org uses regions, you can collect them on the form

Save the form. You get an **embed code** and a **direct link**.

## Embedding a form

- **Embed code**: Copy the HTML snippet from the form’s embed or share section. Paste it into your website or landing page. Submissions post to the app and add subscribers to the selected list.
- **Direct link**: Share the form URL (e.g. `/sites/[orgSlug]/forms/[formSlug]`). Visitors open the page and sign up there.

Public form URLs are under your org’s **sites** domain (e.g. `https://yourapp.com/sites/my-org/forms/my-form`).

## Submissions and revisions

- **Submissions**: View form submissions in the form detail or submissions view. Each submission creates or updates a subscriber on the list.
- **Revisions**: If the app stores form revisions, you can preview or restore previous versions.

## AI and preview

- **AI generate**: Some flows offer AI-generated form copy or layout; use them from the form editor when available.
- **Preview**: Use the draft preview URL (if shown) to see how the form looks before publishing.
