## Orders

**Orders** are created when someone checks out on a drop storefront. Open **Orders** from the sidebar to see all orders across your drops.

## Order list and filters

You can:

- **Filter** by drop, date, or status.
- **Group by location** (e.g. pickup location) to see orders per location.
- **Export** orders (e.g. CSV) for fulfillment or records.
- **Mark ready** — Mark one or many orders as ready for pickup or shipment. Use this when items are prepared.

## Editing an order

You can open an order to update fulfillment status, add notes, or adjust details. Changes are saved and can be visible to the customer depending on your setup.

## Customers and contacts

When someone places an order, they become a **customer** (contact) in your organization. In **Subscribers** you can see contacts with their order history, total spent, and which lists they’re on. You can filter and manage them there.

## Regions and pickup locations

If you use **regions** and **pickup locations**, orders can be assigned to a region and location. Set these up under **Settings** → **Regions**. You can then filter and group orders by location and mark them ready by location.

## List tiers

**List tiers** (e.g. free vs paid) are used in **segments** and to control **drop access**. Manage tiers per list in **Subscribers** → select a list → **Tiers**.
