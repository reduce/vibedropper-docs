## Customers

**Customers** are created when:

- Someone places an **order** on a drop storefront, or
- You add them manually from the **Customers** view

Customers can be linked to **subscribers** (same email). You can view profile (name, email, region, pickup location), **activity**, and use **filter** and **bulk** actions.

### Customers and roles

If your org uses **customer roles**, you can assign roles (e.g. VIP, wholesale) and use them for segmentation or access. Manage roles from **Customers** → **Roles** (or **Settings** → **Roles**).

## Orders

Orders come from the **drop storefront** checkout. From **Orders** in the org you can:

- **List** and **filter** orders by drop, date, status
- **Export** orders (e.g. CSV)
- **Mark ready** (bulk or single) for fulfillment
- **Edit order**: update fulfillment status, notes, or other fields

Each order has customer info, items, totals, and (if used) **region** and **pickup location**.

## Regions and pickup locations

- **Regions**: Define geographic regions for taxes and fulfillment. Used at signup (forms), checkout, and in reporting.
- **Pickup locations**: Optional locations within a region (e.g. pickup points). You can collect pickup at signup and show it at checkout.

Configure regions and locations under **Settings** → **Regions** (or equivalent).

## Tiers (list tiers)

**List tiers** (e.g. free vs paid) are used for:

- **Segments**: Target “tier = paid” in a segment.
- **Drop access**: Allow only certain tiers to access a drop.

Tiers are managed per list under **Lists** → **[list]** → **Tiers**.
