## What are public sites?

Vibedropper hosts **public** pages for your audience: drop storefronts, signup forms, and custom landing pages. Each is tied to your organization and can use your custom domain if you’ve set one up.

## Drop storefront

| Page | What it’s for |
|------|----------------|
| **Drop landing** | Customer enters email; we check if they have access. |
| **Store** | Shopping experience after they’ve signed in (via link we send). |
| **Checkout** | Cart and payment. |
| **Order confirmation** | Order summary and details. |
| **My orders** | List of their orders for that drop. |

Customers visit the drop URL you share, enter their email, and (if they have access) receive a link to the store. They add to cart, checkout, and see their order confirmation.

## Form pages

Your **signup forms** have a public URL. You can:

- **Embed** the form on your own site using the embed code, or
- **Share the link** so people sign up on the form page.

Form URLs look like:  
`https://vibedroppers.com/sites/your-org/forms/your-form`  
(or your custom domain).

## Custom pages

If your plan includes **Pages**, you can create custom landing pages and publish them. Each page has a public URL (e.g. `/sites/your-org/pages/your-page`) that you can share or link to from campaigns and drops.

## Custom domains

By default, public pages use the Vibedropper domain. In **Settings** → **Domains** you can add and verify your own domain so that drop and form URLs use your brand (e.g. `shop.yourbrand.com`). Follow the steps in Settings to add DNS records and verify.
