## Organization settings

Under **Settings** for your org you can configure:

### Branding

- **Brand theme**: Primary, secondary, accent, background, text, and other colors. Used in the dashboard and (where applicable) in emails and public pages.
- **Logo**: Upload or set the org logo. Shown in the dashboard and optionally in emails or public sites.

### Domains

- **Domains**: Add and verify domains (e.g. for public sites or email links). Verification is typically via DNS (TXT or CNAME). Configure sending domain verification for email (SES) as required.

### API keys (Public API)

- **API keys**: Create and revoke keys for the **Public API (v1)**. These keys are scoped to the org. Use them with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-API-Key: <key>` when calling the Public API. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication).

### Webhooks

- **Webhooks**: Configure outbound webhook URLs for events (e.g. subscriber added/removed, campaign sent, order created). The app signs payloads with **HMAC-SHA256**; verify using the `X-Webhook-Signature` header. See [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks).

### Team

- **Members**: View members and their roles (Admin, Member).
- **Invites**: Send email invites. Invitees get a link; accepting adds them to the org with the chosen role.

### Social

- **Social**: Connect social accounts via Late.dev. See [Social integration](/guides/social).

### Regions and roles

- **Regions**: Define geographic regions and pickup locations for taxes and fulfillment.
- **Roles**: If your org uses customer or custom roles, configure them here or from the Customers area.

## Super admin

If your deployment has **super admin** access (e.g. `/super-admin`), you can manage all organizations and platform-wide settings. This is typically restricted to a small set of users (e.g. marked in the database).
