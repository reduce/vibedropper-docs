## Where to find Settings

Open **Settings** from the header or sidebar when you’re in your organization. Settings are organized into tabs or sections: **General**, **Brand**, **Cart**, **Emails**, **Members**, **Regions**, **Domains**, and **API**.

## General

- **Organization name** and **slug** (used in URLs).
- **Website** URL and **logo**.
- **Social links** (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) — optional links shown in your brand presence.

## Brand

- **Brand colors** — Primary, secondary, accent, background, text, and other colors so your dashboard and emails match your look.
- **Fonts** and **typography** (if available).
- **Preview** — See how your brand looks in the shop and in email.

## Cart

- **Cart limits** — Maximum price or weight per cart for your drop storefronts, if your plan supports it.

## Emails

- **Default from name and address** — Who your emails come from (e.g. “My Brand” &lt;hello@yourdomain.com&gt;).
- **Sending domain** — Verify the domain you send from so emails deliver reliably. Use **Sending domains** or the Domains section to add and verify.

## Members

- **Team** — See who’s in your organization and their roles.
- **Invite** — Send an invite by email. The person gets a link to join; when they accept, they’re added with the role you chose.
- **Pending invites** — View and cancel invites that haven’t been accepted yet.

Roles (e.g. Admin, Member, Shop manager) control what each person can do. Admins can change settings and manage the team.

## Regions

- **Regions and pickup locations** — Define geographic regions and pickup points. Used for signup (e.g. on forms), checkout, and fulfillment. You can filter and group orders by location and set taxes per region if supported.

## Domains

- **Custom domains** — Add and verify your own domain so your drop and form URLs use your brand (e.g. `shop.yourbrand.com`). Add the DNS records we show you, then verify.
- **Sending domain** — Verify the domain you use for sending email so inboxes trust your messages.

## API

- **API keys** — Create keys for the Vibedropper API if you want to integrate your own tools or scripts. Keys are scoped to your organization. See the **API reference** in the docs for how to use them.
- **Webhooks** — Configure webhook URLs so Vibedropper can send you events (e.g. new subscriber, campaign sent, order created). Useful for syncing with other systems.
