## Create your account

1. Go to [Vibedropper](https://vibedroppers.com).
2. Click **Get started** or **Sign in**.
3. Sign up with your email and a password, or use Google to sign in.

After you sign in, you’ll be asked to create your first organization if you don’t have one yet.

## Create your organization

Your **organization** is your brand or workspace. Everything you do in Vibedropper—lists, campaigns, drops, orders—belongs to one organization.

1. When prompted, enter your **organization name** and a **slug** (short URL-friendly name, e.g. `my-brand`).
2. Optionally set your **brand colors** and **logo** so your dashboard and emails match your look.
3. Click **Create** to finish.

You can create more organizations later and switch between them from the header.

## Open your dashboard

Once your organization is created, you land on the **Dashboard**. From the sidebar you can go to:

- **Subscribers** — Manage lists and your audience.
- **Campaigns** — Create and send email campaigns.
- **Forms** — Build signup forms to grow your lists.
- **Drops** — Run list-gated product drops (if your plan includes drops).
- **Pages** — Create landing pages.
- **Orders** — View and manage orders from your drops.
- **Products** — Manage your product catalog (admins only, when drops are enabled).

Use **Settings** (in the header or sidebar) to set up branding, domains, team members, and more.
